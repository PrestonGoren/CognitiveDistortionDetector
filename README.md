# Cognitive Distortion Detector

A project utilizing LLM's to analyze thoughts for potential cognitive distortions


## Cognitive Distortions
All-or-Nothing Thinking (Black-and-White Thinking): Viewing situations in only two categories instead of on a continuum.


Overgeneralization: Making broad interpretations from a single or few events.


Mental Filter: Focusing on a single negative detail and dwelling on it so that the vision of reality becomes darkened.


Disqualifying the Positive: Dismissing positive experiences for some reason or another.


Jumping to Conclusions: Making negative interpretations without actual evidence. This includes "Mind Reading" (assuming the thoughts and intentions of others) and "Fortune Telling" (predicting things will turn out badly).


Magnification (Catastrophizing) or Minimization: Blowing things out of proportion or inappropriately shrinking something to make it seem less important.


Emotional Reasoning: Assuming that because we feel a certain way, what we think must be true.


Should Statements: Using "should," "ought to," or "must" statements can lead to guilt and frustration.


Labeling and Mislabeling: Applying global labels to oneself or others based on specific behaviors.


Personalization: Taking responsibility for events outside of one's control.


Some lists and therapists may include additional distortions or slightly different categorizations, but these ten are widely recognized and serve as a foundational tool in identifying and challenging unhelpful thought patterns in CBT.
