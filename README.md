# Cognitive Distortion Detector

A project utilizing LLM's to analyze thoughts for potential cognitive distortions


## Cognitive Distortions
1. All-or-Nothing Thinking (Black-and-White Thinking): Viewing situations in only two categories instead of on a continuum.


2. Overgeneralization: Making broad interpretations from a single or few events.


3. Mental Filter: Focusing on a single negative detail and dwelling on it so that the vision of reality becomes darkened.


4. Disqualifying the Positive: Dismissing positive experiences for some reason or another.


5. Jumping to Conclusions: Making negative interpretations without actual evidence. This includes "Mind Reading" (assuming the thoughts and intentions of others) and "Fortune Telling" (predicting things will turn out badly).


6. Magnification (Catastrophizing) or Minimization: Blowing things out of proportion or inappropriately shrinking something to make it seem less important.


7. Emotional Reasoning: Assuming that because we feel a certain way, what we think must be true.


8. Should Statements: Using "should," "ought to," or "must" statements can lead to guilt and frustration.


9. Labeling and Mislabeling: Applying global labels to oneself or others based on specific behaviors.


10. Personalization: Taking responsibility for events outside of one's control.


Some lists and therapists may include additional distortions or slightly different categorizations, but these ten are widely recognized and serve as a foundational tool in identifying and challenging unhelpful thought patterns in CBT.
